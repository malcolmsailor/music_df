This package features various functions for working with Pandas dataframes representing music scores. [I](https://malcolmsailor.com) developed it for my personal use during my dissertation.

With this library, you can among many other things:

- read from a variety of formats, including MIDI, Humdrum, MusicXML, and others.
- postprocess the scores in various ways, such as salami-slicing, quantizing, dedoubling and de-tremoloing them.
- apply augmentations like transposition (which can be sensitive to pitch-spelling) or time-scaling (which adjusts the time signatures appropriately).
- plot dataframes as piano-rolls or display them as scores, displaying annotations or coloring noteheads.


Documentation (a work-in-progress) can be found [here](https://music-df.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
