Always use the /music_df skill when working on this repository.

If the user asks you to add to the music_df skill, you can find that at `~/.claude/skills/music_df/`.
- only core functionality should go in the main SKILL.md file, which should be kept as brief as possible
- other functions should go into specific sub-files (e.g., harmony.md) that are linked to from the main file

Run python with `venvon && python...`
Run tests with `venvon && pytest...`
